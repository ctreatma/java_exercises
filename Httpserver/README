CIS 555 Homework 2 -- Milestone 1

NOTE:  All code was run & tested on OS X and on the spec machines.  I cannot guarantee that my code will work on Windows, or on a different server.

To run the server:
java edu.upenn.cis555.webserver.Httpserver <port> <root directory> [<path to web.xml>]

To run the unit tests:
java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore edu.upenn.cis555.test.AllTests

The XPath servlets web.xml is included in the submitted directory as 'web.xml.'

To run the XPath servlets (from inside hw2m2 dir):
java edu.upenn.cis555.webserver.Httpserver <port> path/to/hw2m2/  web.xml

To run the XPath crawler:
java edu.upenn.cis555.xpath.XPathCrawler <start url> <path to db env> <max size MB> [<max files>]

The XSL stylesheet for the War and Peace feeds is 'rss.xsl.'
The XPaths for the War and Peace feeds are in 'warandpeace.xp.'

Source files are in src/, class files are in bin/.
It didn't seem like jar files were required this time, so I didn't provide them.
Keep in mind, classes from previous submissions may have been updated since then, so please don't use jar files from my previous submissions.

Implemented classes:

   edu.upenn.cis555.db:
      XPathDB:	wrapper for the Berkeley DB environment
      Channel:  class for representing a channel
      CrawledURL: class for representing a crawled URL
      User:  class for representing a user

   edu.upenn.cis555.xpath
      XPathCrawler: the web crawler
      CreateChannelServlet: path is /createChannel
                            provides & handles form for creating a channel
      DeleteChannelServlet: path is /deleteChannel(?channel=x)
                            deletes the specified channel if the logged-in user created it
      LoginServlet: path is /login
                    provides & handles form for logging in
      LogoutServlet: path is /logout
                     logs the user out (if a user is logged in)
      RegisterServlet: path is /register
                       provides & handles the user registration form
      ShowChannelServlet: path is /showChannel(?channel=x)
                          generates the xml for the specified channel
      ShowChannelsServlet: path is /showChannels
                           displays a list of available channels, w/ links to view/delete

   edu.upenn.cis555.test:
      AllTests:  The whole test suite
      XPathDBTest: Unit tests for the XPathDB class
      XPathCrawlerTest: Unit tests for the XPathCrawler class
