CIS 700
Project 4 - Android

For this assignment I implemented (partially) the TurnBlue assignment that Dave
has used in previous courses.  The game board is comprised of 64 buttons that
switch color between red and blue.  The goal of the game is to turn the board
entirely blue in order to get to the next level.

Really, the only things to see here are:
    The buttons responding to input
    The sheer number of GUI widgets
