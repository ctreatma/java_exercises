Fir
#
Abies. Fir.  Beautiful monoecious evergreen trees of substantial
richly-
foliaged aspect, often stately, some of them becoming great forest
trees; 
nearly fourty species in the Northern hemisphere ( as far south as 
Guatemala in the western hemisphere and as northern Africa and the 
Himalayas in the eastern ) and most of them introduced to cultivation
for 
ornament and many of them utilized as timber trees. Leaves persistent
for 
many years, not shedding when the twig is dried, and leaving a hollow 
circular scar as they fall. Abies is the ancient Latin name of the 
silver-fir.

The firs are mostly slow-growing trees requiring a cool climate for
best 
results, and often demand considerable attention before becoming well 
established. Mostly they are injured by dust and smoke and are
therefore 
not well adapted to planting in the interior of cities.

The firs are not variable in cultivation as are many other classes of 
conifers. Firs are propagated from seeds. The species with glaucous or 
bluish foliage are often called silver firs, as A. alba, amabilis, 
concolor, Delavayi, grandis, Veitchii.

Abies grandis
Grand Fir
#
The A.S. Field Guide to North American Trees:

Grand Fir, "Lowland White Fir", "Lowland Fir", Abies Grandis. One of
the 
tallest true firs. Habitat: Valleys and mountain slopes in cool humid 
climate; in coniferous forests. Range: S. British Columbia south along 
coast to California; also south in Rocky Mountain region to central
Idaho;
to 1,500 feet (457 m) along coast; to 6,000 feet inland.

Common and scientific names refer to the large size; the champion in 
Olympic National Park, Washington, is 231 feet (70.4 m) tall with a 
circumference of 20' 8" (6.3 m). Like those of related species, the 
smooth bark of small trunks has swellings or blisters; when pinched or 
opened, fragrant, transparent resin or balsam squirts out.

Acer
Maple
#
Bonsai, the art and technique:

During the growing season, provide a location with partial shade and,
if 
possible, early morning sun. Several hours of sun daily shortens the 
internodes and heightens the color of the fall foliage.

Unlike most trees, after maples are pruned drastically, they send out
new 
shoots from buds beneath the bark, as well as from buds already formed
on 
the shoots and branches. Maples exude an alarming flow of sap if
pruned 
in the spring. "Bleeding" can be avoided by pruning later in the
season.

Bud formation in pairs on opposite sides of a shoot establishes an 
unwanted branching pattern. This is easily remedied by removing one of 
the two buds in early spring. Simply rub or snap the bud off with the 
fingers.

Water regularly and protect from drying conditions.

Paper Birch
#
The A.S. Field Guide to North American Trees:

Paper Birch, Canoe Birch, White Birch, (Betula papyrifera).  One of
the 
most beautiful native trees, with narrow, open crown of slightly
drooping 
to nearly horizontal branches; sometimes a shrub. Chalky to creamy
white, 
smooth, thin bark, with long horizontal lines, separating into papery 
strips to reveal orange inner bark. Habitat: moist upland soils and 
cutover lands; often in nearly pure stands. Range: transcontinental 
across North America near northern limit of trees from NW Alaska, east 
to Labrador, south to New York, and west to Oregon; local south to N. 
Colorado and W. North Carolina; to 4,000 feet (1219 m), higher in
southern
mountains. Paper Birch is used for specialty products such as ice
cream 
sticks, toothpicks, spools, and toys, as well as pulpwood. Indians
made 
their lightweight, birchbark canoes by stretching the stripped bark
over 
frames of Northern White-cedar, sewing it with thread from Tamarack
roots,
and caulking the seams with pine or Balsam Fir resin. Souvenirs of
birch
bark should always be taken from a fallen log, since stripping bark
from 
living trees leaves a permanent, ugly scars.

Bonsai, the art and technique:

Need partial sun or light shade. As a bonsai, hornbeam does not
respond 
to pruning as well as the maples; allow more time to develop dense 
branching.

Use a basic potting mix and keep the soil moist, but not wet, between 
waterings. For less frequent watering, add moisture-retention
ingredients 
such as sphagnum peat moss to the mix. Repot every year or two in the 
spring and trim roots regularly, especially the taproot, if
present. Do 
not let the roots become so large that drastic pruning will be
required. 
If large roots are present, remove them over a period of time.

Chamaecyparis
False Cypress
#
The Cultivated Conifer:

Chamaecyparis. False-Cypress. Monoecious ( having male and female sex 
organs on the same plant, i.e. hermaphroditic ) evergreen aromatic
trees 
of six species in North America and eastern Asia closely allied with 
Cupressus. The name Chamaecyparis is apparently an adaptation of
Pliny's 
Chamae-cyparissus, "ground-cypress", derived from Greek chamai, on the 
ground, and kuparissos, cypress, although its species are not lower
but 
generally taller than the true cypresses. The false-cypresses are
hardy 
trees. The old genus Retinispora or Retinospora represents the
juvenile 
forms of Chamaecyparis and Thuja.

C. formosensis, Formosa Cypress. Formosa.
C. nootkatensis, Nootka Cypress or Yellow Cedar. Southwestern Alaska
to 
Oregon. First made known from Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island.
C. obtusa, Hinoki Cypress.  Japan.

Bonsai, the art and technique:

Thin white lines on the underside of the leaves distinguish
Chamaecyparis 
from Thuja, arborvitae, which has a similar appearance.  They grow
best 
in partial sun and shade; protect them from hot midday
sun. Chamaecyparis,
like Cedrus, are moisture loving trees. Give them growing areas free
of 
drying winds. These species respond favorable to wiring and moderate 
pruning. Use a basic potting mix completely free of lime. Spring is
the 
prefered time for repotting, but Chamaecyparis can be repotted with
care 
during the growing season.

Lawson Cypress or Port Orford Cedar.
#
The Cultivated Conifer:

Chamaecyparis Lawsoniana, Lawson Cypress. Noble forest tree of the 
Northwest, known in cultivation in great numbers of named forms but in 
nature not represented in recognized botanical varieties, one of the 
most beautiful conifers for planting; to 200 feet. Seeds of this
cypress 
were sent in 1854 by William Murray to the Lawson nurseries at
Edinburgh, 
Charles Lawson, 1794-1873, being head of the firm. Moist hillsides and 
canyons, southwestern Oregon and northern California; known also as
Port 
Orford Cedar.  This is one of the most beautiful conifers and it forms
in 
cultivation usually narrow pyramidal trees densely furnished to the 
ground with branches; it is very variable, and with about 80 garden 
varieties.

Port-Orford-cedar, "Oregon Cedar, "Lawson Cypress" Chamaecyparis 
lawsoniana. Port-Orford-cedar is adapted to the humid climate of the 
Pacific Coast with its wet winters and frequent summer fog. Logs of
the 
aromatic wood are exported to Japan for woodenware and toys and for
the 
construction of shrines and temples; a special use is for arrow
shafts. 
Many horticultural varieties are grown as ornamentals and shade trees, 
especially in European countries with moist climates. The names honor 
Port Orford, Oregon, located in the center of the range, and Peter 
Lawson and his sons, Scottish nurserymen who introduced the tree to
European nurseries.

Cedrus
Cedars
#
The Cultivated Conifer:

Cedrus. Cedar. Four very similar evergreen monoecious or dioecious
trees 
of the Mediterranean region and western Himalayas, perhaps to be 
regarded as geographic forms of a single species; trees of striking 
appearance in age, with branches horizontally spreading and irregular 
and massive trunks. Cedrus, Latinized from kedros, a name employed in 
ancient Greek for resinous trees, cheifly juniper.

C. libantica, Cedar of Lebanon. Asia Minor on the Taurus and
Antitaurus 
Mountains, and the Lebanon Mountains of Syria where it is said to be
now 
rare. Closely related is C. brevifolia, of the island of Cyprus.
C. atlantica, Atlas Cedar. Atlas Mountains of Algeria and Morocco.
C. Deodara, Deodar Cedar. Western Himalaya at 4,000 feet and above. 
Deodar is a name in India for certain trees associated with temples.

Bonsai, the art and technique:

Athough many evergreens are called cedars, members of the genus Cedrus 
are the true cedars. Provide a growing area with partial sun and open 
shade. Avoid exposure to hot sun or drying conditions. Repot in June
or 
later when the soil is warm and the roots are growing actively. At
each 
repotting prune the taproot if it has elongated.

Hackberry
#
Bonsai, the art and technique:

Hackberries are deciduous trees with alternate leaves that are
lopsided 
at the base and turn yellow in the fall. These trees are vigorous 
growers. Place them in partial sun and open shade. They are tolerant
of 
both pruning and wiring.  Use a basic soil mix, but keep it slightly 
moist between waterings. Because their roots  grow actively in a 
container, repot in the spring of every or every other year, whenever 
the root fill the container. Apply fertilizer regularly.

The Chinese Hackberry is a trouble-free bonsai, relatively immune to 
pests and disease.

#
Bonsai, the art and technique:

Deciduous or evergreen shrubs with alternate leaves and showy flowers 
that appear in early spring before the leaves.  Provide partial sun 
outdoors and a sunny window or high levels of artificial light
indoors. 
Winter protection is required in cold climates.

Prune severly immediately after flowering to allow flower buds to form 
during the summer for the following year. In early spring, before
flowers 
appear, remove dead wood and unwanted branches.  Pinch back new growth 
through the end of June to maintain a compact form. After June, as new 
growth continues, remove the terminal bud on each shoot to strengthen
the 
lateral flowering buds.  Use a basic mix and repot, when potbound,
early 
in the spring or after flowering. Remove large old roots. Fertilize 
regularly in the early spring when new growth has begun and again
during 
the summer after flowering.

Quince are self-sterile. If fruits are wanted on C. specisa, place the 
bonsai in the vicinity of other flowering quince when it is in flower.

#
The A.S. Field Guide to North American Trees:

Rose family (Rosaceae).  About 2000 species of trees, shrubs, and
herbs 
worldwide; approximately 77 native and nine naturalized tree species
and 
many species of shrubs and herbs in North America; including 
serviceberries (Amalanchier), hawthorns (Crataegus), apples (Malus), 
plums and cherries (Prunus), and mountain-ashes (Sorbus).

Crataegus, commonly known as Hawthorn, Haw, Thorn-apple, Red Haw, or 
Hog-apple, is a large genus of difficult-to-distinguish species. Many  
branched shrubs and small spreading trees, they commonly have a dense, 
rounded or flattened crown and long thorns. About seven species are 
native in western United States and about 30 in eastern states, though 
several hundred have been named.

Washington Hawthorn, "Washington-thorn", Crataegus phaenopyrum. Shrub
or 
small tree with short trunk and regular, rounded crown of upright 
branches, abundant small flowers in the spring, many small, round red 
fruits, and brilliant autumn foliage; hairless throughout. Habitat:
moist

and 
north to S. Missouri; naturalized locally northeast to Massachusetts;
to 
2,000 feet (610 m). Planted for ornament in the west. This is one of

Cupressus
Cypress
#
The Cultivated Conifers:

Cupressus. Monoecious evergreen trees, or sometimes shrubby, with 
shredding bark and aromatic foliage, about a dozen species, as the 
genus is now defined, in the Pacific North America and Mexico and in 
the eastern hemisphere from southeastern Europe to China, some of them 
well known in cultivation in the warmer parts of the United States and 
the tropics.

Bonsai, the art and technique:

Cupressus. The true cypress, a coniferous evergreen of mild
climates. An 
upright trunk us a natural style for the trees discussed here. For 
Monterey and Italian Cypress provide year-round warm temperatures 
accompanied by bright light and sun. For compact foliage, pinch new 
growth when it is 1/4 to 1/2 an inch long. These species respond 
favorably to regular pruning and wiring. Use a basic potting mix ad
let 
the soil become slightly dry between waterings. Most cypresses are
easily 
propagated from seed.

The Cultivated Conifer:

Juniperus resembles Cupressus in many ways, and sometimes is difficult 
to distinguish without fruit; but young plants with needle-shaped
leaves 
can usually be told apart, since Juniperus has the whitish bands or 
marks on the upper surface of the leaves, while the similar juvenile 
forms of allied genera have the whitish marks underneath. Often it is 
difficult to determine between species of junipers themselves, unless 
one has mature fruits.

Larix
Larch
#
The Cultivated Conifers:

Annually deciduous monoecious conifers of the cooler and higher parts
of 
the northern hemisphere. Ten species. Larix is the ancient Latin name
of 
the larch tree. They are notable among the conifers, with Pseudolarix
and 
some of the Taxodiums, in having a complete leaf-fall in autumn and a 
vivid revival in spring. Although they sometimes inhabit wet grounds
or 
even swamps, they thrive in the drier lands of parks and estates.

L. decidua,  European Larch
L. Gmelini,  Dahurian Larch, Northeastern Asia. The Latin name 
commemorates Samuel Gottlieb Gmelini, 1743-1774, botanist and traveler 
in Russia. The English name refers to a region in Asia. Vars. are 
japonica ( Kurile Larch) and Principis Rupprechtii ( Prince Rupprecht 
Larch).
L. laricina,  Tamarack, American Larch.
L. pendula,  Weeping Larch. Supposed hybrid of L. laricina and
L. decidua.
Originated in England before 1800.
L. Kaempferi,  Japanese Larch. (L. leptolepsis). Named in memory of 
Engelbert Kaempfer, born 1631, early traveler in Japan.
L. eurolepsis,  Dunkeld Larch, from the place in Scotland where it

Malus sylvestris
Apple
#
The A.S. Field Guide to North American Trees:

Rose family (Rosaceae).

Apple, "Common Apple", "Wild Apple", Malus sylvestris. This familiar 
fruit tree, naturalized locally, has a short trunk, spreading, rounded 
crown, showy pink-tinged blossoms, and delicious red fruit. Habitat: 
moist soils near houses, fences, roadsides, and clearings. Range:
Native 
of Europe and W. Asia. Naturalized locally across S. Canada, in E. 
continental United States, and in Pacific states.

The apple has been cultivated since ancient times. Numerous improved 
varieties have been developed from this species and from hybrids with 
related species. Although well known, it is sometimes not recognized 
when growing wild. For nearly fifty years Jonathan Chapman ( 1774-1845
), 
better known as Johnny Appleseed, travelling mostly on foot,
distributed 
apple seeds to everyone he met. With seeds from cider presses, he
helped 
to establish orchards from Pennsylvania to Illinois. Wildlife consume 
quantities of the fallen fruit after harvest.

Spruce
#
The Cultivated Conifers:

Picea. Spruce. Well-known pyramidal or conical monoecious evergreen
trees 
of the habit and aspect of Abies (Fir) but the leaves mostly strongly 
angled or even squared in cross-section and each borne on a little
foot 
(sterigma, plural sterigmata, from Greek meaning a support or prop)
which 
is a projection from a cushion (pulvinus) that makes an elevation 
lengthwise the branchlet, disarticulating (falling) from the
sterigmata 
when they die leaving the twig rough from the projecting points and 
shedding when a branch is cut and dried. Cones deflexed or hanging (or
at 
least not erect) and not shattering on maturity. About fourty species 
around the earth in the Northern hemisphere. Picea is the ancient
Latin 
name of the spruce, derived from pix, pitch. 

The spruces occur from the arctic circle to high mountains of warm-
temperate regions.  In cultivation they are much more adaptable and 
easily grown than the firs. Piceas are particularly difficult of 
identification, so closely do they resemble each other though really 
distinct.

Pinus
Pines
#
The Cultivated Conifer:

Pinus. Pines. Stately evergreen monoecious trees, also dwarf forms, of 
some eighty species in the northern hemisphere, extending from the
high 
North to uplands in the tropics.

They are long-lived durable trees, indespensible on ample areas for
long-
time landscape effect, for shade and shelter, and are pleasing
contrast 
to the urge for "immediate effect" and for transitory things. They
impart 
elements of strength and permanence. Pines are of simple
requirements. 
They are rugged subjects. Propagation is by means of seeds.

Subgenus Diploxylon. Hard, Red, or Pitch pines: bracts as base of
leaf-
fascicles decurrent or running down the stem: sheath of fascicle
usually 
persistent: leaves serrulate or rough on edges: wood hard, mostly
dark, 
commonly strongly resinous.

Subgenus Haploxylon. Soft, or White pines: bracts as base of fascicles
on 
young growth not decurrent: sheath of leaf-fascicle commonly soon 
deciduous or falling: leaves often or commonly smooth on edges: wood 
soft, with little resin, not deeply colored.

Pinus strobiformis
Border White Pine
#
The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees:

"Southwestern White Pine", "Mexican White Pine", "Border White Pine", 
Pinus strobiformis. Habitat: Dry, rocky slopes and canyons in high 
mountains; a minor component of coniferous forests. Range: Trans-Pecos 
Texas west to E. central Arizona; also New Mexico; at 6500-10,000 feet 
(1981-3048 m).  The large seeds are consumed by wildlife and were
eaten 
by southwestern Indians.  This species of the Mexican border region
was 
formerly considered a southern variety of Limber Pine, which has a 
broader, more northern distribution, is smaller, and has smooth-edged 
needles with white lines on all surfaces (P. strobiformis has white 
lines on inner surfaces only), and shorter cones with thick, rounded, 
blunt-pointed cone-scales.

Salix
Willow
#
The A.S. Field Guide to North American Trees:

Willow family (Salicaceae).  Deciduous, often aromatic trees, shrubs. 
About 350 species in the genera willow (Salix) and poplar (Populus); 
nearly worldwide, mostly in north temperate and arctic regions. 35
native 
and 5 naturalized tree species and about 60 native shrub species in
North 
America.

The large genus of willows (Salix), characteristic of wet soils,
includes 
shrubs and mostly small trees, often forming thickets. Leaves are
narrow 
and commonly long-pointed and finely toothed, with distinct odor when 
crushed, turning yellow in autumn. The slender or wiry twigs are
tough, 
flexible, often shedding or detached at forks. The numerous tiny seeds 
have tufts of white, cottony hairs.

drooping branches. Height: 30-40 feet. Native of China. Naturalized 
locally from extreme S. Quebec and S. Ontario, south to Georgia, and 
west to Missouri. Also planted in the West.

This willow is well known for its distinctive weeping foliage. It is 
among the first willows to bear leaves in the spring and among the
last 
to shed them in autumn. China, not Babylon, was its native home; when 
named, it was confused with Euphrates Poplar (Populus euphratica).

The Cultivated Conifer:

Sequoia. Two titanic monoecious evergreen trees in the Pacific region
of 
North America o
f much public interest, prized for ornament in regions in which they 
thrive. Named for Sequoyah, a Cherokee half-breed of Georgia,
originator 
of the Cherokee alphabet; about 1770-1843.

S. sempervirens. California Coast Redwood. Very tall, to 300 and more 
feet, trunk 10-25 feet in diameter and often clear of limbs for 100
feet 
in mature specimens; narrow crown with horizontal or downward sweeping 
branches. Confined to northern and central coast ranges of southern 
Oregon and northern California, rarely more than thirty miles from the 
coast, forming extensive forests. It holds the record as the tallest
tree 
in the world, at least so far as actual measurements have been made,
one 
specimen in Humbolt county, California, measuring 340 feet according
to 
Sargent. Var. adpressa, var. glauca, Blue Redwood, var. pendula.

S. gigantea. Big Tree. Prodigious tree, 150-275, rarely to 325 feet
high, 
with trunk 10-30 feet in diameter, crown pyramidal on young trees, 
rounded at summit or much broken in age; bark cinnamon-red, 1-2 feet 
thick. Western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, California, in several

Metasequoia glyptostroboides
Dawn Redwood
#
The Cultivated Conifer ( written 1933, before the Dawn Redwood was 
discovered):

Glyptostrobus. Genus separated from Taxodium, differing in the cone-
scales, cones, seeds with small wings, and dimorphic leaves. One 
monoeious deciduous tree in wet places in southeastern China.  The
name 
means carved cone, alluding to the configuration of the scales.

G. pensilis.  Chinese Water-Pine or Bald Cypress. Small tree with
broad 
base. Little known in North America, although introduced, and probably 
adapted only in the warmer parts of the country.

See entry under Sequoia, also.

Evergreens:

Metasequoia. M. glyptostroboides (Dawn Redwood). Until 1945 the Dawn 
Redwood was known only through fossils collected by paleobotanists and 
was thought to have been extinct for perhaps a million years. After it 
was discovered alive and well in the remote village of Motao-chi in
the 
Chinese province of Szechwan, the Arnold Arboretum of Boston sent a 
special expedition to the area. The seeds collected were shared with 
other botanical gardens around the world, and this deciduous conifer
is 
now widely available. Mature trees in China are broadly conical and
grow 
about 100 feet tall from thick buttressed roots. Presumably they will 
eventually attain a similar size in this country. Soft, bright green 
needles, about 3/4 inch long appear in early spring, then turn pinkish 
brown before falling in the autumn. It thrives in full sun in almost
any 
moist soil.

Taxus
Yew
#
The Cultivated Conifers:

The taxads, constituting the natural family Taxaceae, are gynmosperms 
without true cones. Includes Taxus, Dacrydium, Phyllocladus,
Saxegothaea, 
Podocarpus, Cephalotaxus, and Torreya.

Taxus.  Yew. Evergreen mostly dioecious trees and shrubs with long, 
linear, aternate mostly 2-ranked flat leaves green underneath, little 
scaly winter-buds, small usually axillary flowers in early spring from 
buds of previous autumn, the staminate in little heads of 4-8 stamens, 
pistillate of a single ovule ripenning into a hard little nutlet
sitting 
in a fleshy ring or cup that is normally scarlet but in some varieties 
yellow. Widely istributed in the northern hemisphere and one crossing
the 
equator; species considered by Pilger and others to be one, with 
subspecies or varieties in different parts of world, but for our
purposes 
at least regarded as perhaps seven or eitht species that may ve 
separately named. It is impossible toa make a key to the species that 
will cove the exceptions met in the horticultural varieties. The
scales 
of the winter-buds  are usually good marks of identification of
species; 
these scales may be seen throughout the summer persisting at the base
of 
the seasons growth.

The European Yew is closely associated with folk-lore and history, and 
has long been in cultivation in many forms.  All the yews are
interesting 
and attractive where they can be well grown. They are slow-growing and 
durable subjects; usually thrive in partially shady places where not
too 
dry. Propagation is by seeds, which should germinate the second year; 
also by cuttings and sometimes by layering.

temperate regions of North America, and the eastern Himalayas to
Japan. 
Tsuga is the Japanese name of the genus. At first the hemlocks were 
included in Pinus and then in Abies and Picea; it was not until 1855 
that they were separated as a genus by themselves. Cones are very
similar 
to those of the Larch. Hemlocks are raised from seeds, and the 
horticultural varieties are grafted on T. canadensis.

Columbia south in Rocky Mountains to N. Idaho and NW. Montana.

Western Hemlock is one of the most common trees in the Pacific
Northwest, 
forming vast, dense groves. An important timber species, it is one of 
the best pulpwoods and a source of alpha celulose for making
cellophane, 
rayon, yarns, and plastics. Indians of southeastern Alaska used to
