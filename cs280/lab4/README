Everything seems to work the way it should.
To make the SecNet test program, make sec_net.
Usage:
sec_net <graphtype> <input> <algorithm>
graphtype is 0 or 1, depending on whether you want a matrixgraph or a listgraph
input is the name of the graph file, i.e. estonia.gph
algorithm is 0 or 1: 0 for Kruskal, 1 for Prim

I'm pretty sure everything else works as described in the lab.

Answers in mem_limit.txt were deduced using the graph_gen program.
