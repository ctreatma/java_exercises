Everything seems to work as it should, without any segfaults or "super magic
transportation event warps" (I'm practicing to work for Nintendo).  Sometimes
maze_viewer goes wacky, and that's not at all my fault, so if maze_viewer
magically decides it's not going to display a search..then yeah, it's not my
fault, because everything works.

Note:
I changed the color assignment for BreadthSearchPath in path.cc so that breadth
and depth first searches don't show up the same color, because not being able
to tell them apart bothered me deeply.
