EGYPTIAN MANCALA:

1. Players must select nonempty bins on their own sides, other than
   their goals (kalahas).
2. After selecting a bin, the player picks up all of the pieces in
   that bin and puts one piece per bin going around the board
   counterclockwise.
3. While putting the pieces down, a player should skip over her
   opponent's kalaha.
4. If the last piece lands in a player's own kalaha, she gets to go again.
5. If the last piece lands in an empty bin ownd by the player whose
   turn it is, she must put that piece into her own Kalaha. In addition,
   she gets to take all the pieces in the opposite bin.
6. If a player, on her turn (or at the end of her turn), 
   has no more pieces on her side, the other
   player gets to collect all the pieces on his side and place them
   into his kalaha. The game is now over, and the winner is the player
   with the most pieces in her kalaha.
7. Tricky Rule: A player cannot make a move that will cause her
   opponent's side to be empty if there is another move which will not
   have this effect.
