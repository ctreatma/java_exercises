DBase Relational Schema

This is my conversion from the E/R diagram to a relational schema.
I'm pretty certain it's in BCNF and 4NF, but this wouldn't be the
first time I've been wrong...In lieu of underlining, key attributes
are preceded and followed by a dash, i.e. "-SSN-".  I'm working on a
remote terminal and don't know emacs quite well enough to tell it to
underline things.

Landlord(-SSN-, firstname, lastname, phone, email);
House(-street-, numbeds, numbaths);
Owns(-street-, -SSN-);
Lease(-street-, months, rent, gasYN, sewerYN);
Rents(-street-, -Tnumber-);
Student(-Tnumber-, firstname, lastname, phone, OCMR, year, email,
		   dorm, room);
Compatible(-wantingTnum-, -wantedTnum-);
